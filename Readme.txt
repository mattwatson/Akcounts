This is a C# Accounts package I designed and wrote as a learning exercise.

Setting up a Development environment

1) Install Visual Studio 2012 or Visual Studio 2010 SP1

2) Open Akcounts\Akcounts\Akcounts.sln in Visual Studio

There are some dummy datafiles included in the Akcounts\Akcounts\Akcounts.UI\Data folder
